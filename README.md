array_lib
======

A JavaScript Array library.  Inspired by Python and Scheme's SRFI-1.

[Python's list methods can be found here.]()
[The spec for SRFI-1 can be found here.](http://srfi.schemers.org/srfi-1/srfi-1.html)



## Naming ##

Most functions are non-destructive, that is, they don't modify the original array.  Functions which do modify the original array end with a $ symbol.


## Tests ##

A test suite is included in the library. Currently it is part of the main array_lib.js file and is run upon loading the library.
