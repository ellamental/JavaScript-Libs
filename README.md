JavaScript-Libs is... wait for it... a collection of JavaScript libraries.  These libraries were created to further my own understanding of JavaScript and are not (currently) meant to be used in production code.

## [array.js](https://github.com/jacktrades/JavaScript-Libs/wiki/array.js)

The array.js library is a library of array functions inspired by [Scheme's SRFI-1](http://srfi.schemers.org/srfi-1/srfi-1.html).

## [set.js](https://github.com/jacktrades/JavaScript-Libs/wiki/set.js)

The set.js library is a library of set functions.

## [srfi1.js](https://github.com/jacktrades/JavaScript-Libs/wiki/srfi1.js)
