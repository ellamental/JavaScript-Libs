jslibs
======

jslibs is a collection of miscellaneous Javascript libraries.  These libraries are meant for my own personal use and education and probably should not be used in production code.

random.js
---------

A library for psudo-random selection of numbers or elements in a collection (currently focusing on array objects, but will be extended to work on objects as well).

collections.js
--------------

A library for operations on collections (arrays and object properties).
